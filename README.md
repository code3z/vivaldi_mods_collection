IMPORTANT: These mods are pulled from outside sources and you should check for security issues before using.

To download, git clone recursively:

More details will be provided.
Mods are collected from Git Repositories on github or other platforms such as gitlab.
Mods are installed via LonMcGregor's custom.py script.

To participate, put your mods in a git repository and submit an issue.


To update this repository, I have created a collection_update.sh.

Before to update your own copy you should first backup mods/custom.js.
