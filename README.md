# Collection of mods for the Vivaldi Web Browser pulled from many sources

IMPORTANT: These mods are pulled from outside sources and you should check for security issues before using.

To download, git clone recursively:
```git clone https://github.com/code3z/vivaldi_mods_collection.git --recursive```


More details will be provided.
Mods are collected from Git Repositories on github or other platforms such as gitlab.
Mods are installed via LonMcGregor's custom.py script.

To participate, put your mods in a git repository and submit an issue.


To update this repository, I have created a collection_update.sh.

Before to update your own copy you should first backup mods/custom.js.
